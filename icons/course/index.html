      <i>Mathematics Undergraduate</i>
      <p>I gained a strong foundation in mathematics from my undergraduate studies. Linear algebra, Abstract Algebra, Analysis and so on.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Cambridge University</h3>
      <i>Masters in Mathematics</i>
      <p>I focused primary on number theory during this course. I took courses on combinatorial and analytic number theory, finite simple groups and category theory. I write my dissertation on seive theory.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Astronomy with an online Telescope</h3>
      <i>Open University</i>
      <p>This course was absolutely fantastic. We learned to make requests from the COAST telescope to study and measure variable stars. The data from all students is collated in order to build a long term graph which is used to calculate attributes of the star.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">An introduction to exoplanets</h3>
      <i>Open University</i>
      <p>I took this course right after the online telescope course because it gave me so much momentum and excitement to study more astronomy. This course started by teaching us about our own solar system and then extrapolating that to what may occur at other stars. It taught us the methods and calculations involved in the recent discovery of exoplanets, in particular hot jupiters.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Discovering Computer Networks</h3>
      <i>Open University</i>
      <p>This is a CISCO style networking course. We used packet-tracer to build simulated models of common computer networks and to practice configuring the routers, switches and other devices involved. I learned about subnet masks and the OSI layers from this course.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Learning from Major Cyber Incidents</h3>
      <i>Open University</i>
      <p>I became interested in how we can protect our cyber infrastructure after witnessing the WannaCry system cause a lot of chaos globally. This course covered that as well as the stuxnet worm which damaged nuclear equipment in another country.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Introduction to Galois Theory</h3>
      <i>Coursera</i>
      <p>This was a very difficult course but the mathematics is an importanting building block in other things I plan to learn, so taking this online course helped me ensure that I was learning it rigorously.</p>

  <div class="course">
    <img src="coursera - complex.png" class="course-thumbnail" />
    <div><h3 class="course-title">Introduction to Complex Analysis</h3>
      <i>Coursera</i>
      <p>This was a short but very useful complex analysis course. It covered the basic theory of holomorphic functions, contour integrals and it also went into the mathematics of Mandelbrot and Julia fractals a bit.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</h3>
      <i>MIT OpenCourseWare</i>
      <p>This course helped me get a strong understanding of recursion as well as a deeper look into the internal workings of programming language interpreters and compilers.</p>

    <div><h3 class="course-title">Circuits and Electronics</h3>
      <i>MIT OpenCourseWare</i>
      <p>This course gave me a much more solid grounding of electronic circuits. Learning Kirchoff's Law was one of the most illuminating moments for me. It enabled me to build my own electronics projects.</p>
