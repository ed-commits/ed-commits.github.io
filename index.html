                <i>Professional Software Development</i>
                <p>This is a 4 month intense(!) course on full stack software development. We learned everything from frontend to backend, software development methodologies and test driven development. We built our own projects over the weekends and also did complex group projects that lasted a week each. It's been a fantastic experience.</p>

                <p>This was our mid-course group project that we made in less than a week! We built an entire game in the browser using a mongodb backend we built with nodejs/express to hold the story, monsters and items in. The rest of the game is implemented in javascript with Vue.js. It was fantastic fun working with Keith, Ollie and Jack on this!</p>

                <i>Social media mobile app</i>
                <p>This was our final group project that we made in one week! We jumped straight into using a technology that we had never used before: React-Native. It was challenging but we managed to build an excellent prototype mobile app as a team. We built a backend that supported account creation and the app was able to place profiles on the map and users are able to chat with other users through it. It was awesome working with Jack, Craig, Rumen and Nourhan on this.</p>

                <p>I created this to consolidate my learning about making use of public JSON APIs. This page pulls information from various online APIs that provide information about space. I also use the browsers LocalStorage to save which tabs the user wants to keep open.</p>

                <p>I took this course right after the online telescope course because it gave me so much momentum and excitement to study more astronomy. This course started by teaching us about our own solar system and then extrapolating that to what may occur at other stars. It taught us the methods and calculations involved in the recent discovery of exoplanets, in particular hot jupiters.</p>
